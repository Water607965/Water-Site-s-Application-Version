Extended Version (Icon) !

As we've seen, we've demonstrated your way through how you can create the water application on your own on a modern Mac without any concerns, issues, or relatable distresses.

However, there isn't something right for the icon, as it is not a PNG file and is instead, a water logo that has a white background.

To fix this, go to this link (https://webstockreview.net/images/water-icon-png-3.png) and save the image.

Afterwards, here are the steps to correctly assign the water icon:

1. Go to finder 📁.
2. Go the water application 💧.
3. Click on the water application once 💧.
4. Do (Command + I) on your keyboard ⌨️.
5. Drag the real water icon to the icon as seen in the information window that you just opened 💧.
6. That's it! You've fully corrected the water application 🔌.
7. Have fun and have a great day 🪐 !
