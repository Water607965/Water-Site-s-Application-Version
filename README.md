# Water-Site-s-Application-Version
Hello ðŸ‘‹! This is a web-based application of the water site. You must've seen this on the water site (sites.google.com/view/who-is-water) about this. You can download this to a computer, but it unfortunately must only be a MacOs operating system for it to work.

Download Process:

1. Click the "code" button in Github.
2. Download the ZIP file.
3. Open the ZIP file and find the water application.
4. Open the water application.
5. That's it! You've successfully opened the water site with ease as an application on your former computer.
6. Finalization sub-step: The icon is incorrect, as MacOS defaults to this inaccurate icon. You can get the correct water icon of the water site to appear as the water icon correctly on the application by copying the icon from this site (http://all-about-water-filters.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Icon-water-blue.svg_.png) and then changing the application's icon in MacOS (Research if you don't know how to!)
7. You're perfectly done!
