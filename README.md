# Water-Site-s-Application-Version
Hello 👋! This is a web-based application of the water site. You must've seen this on the water site (sites.google.com/view/who-is-water) about this. You can download this to a computer, but it unfortunately must only be a MacOs operating system for it to work for the application. However, you can get an internet viewing file on any OS, which is what the second part is. It's not a formal application as a website, but it is an internet viewing file that can take you to the website.

Download Process 🔽 (For Application):

1. Before taking a look at the downlad process, ensure that you have your safari web browser launched.
2. Go to the website (https://sites.google.com/view/who-is-water).
3. Go to the help menu in the Mac menu bar and type in "add to dock". Go to this link to see the screenshot for a better view (https://github.com/Water607965/Water-Site-s-Application-Version/assets/151555387/c28e6949-cdb8-47f3-bc50-403c4cd90797)

5. Run the application on your computer.
