# 👋 Introduction 👋 !
Hello 👋! This is a web-based application of the water site. You can download this to a computer, but it unfortunately must only be a MacOs operating system for it to work for the application. However, you can get an internet viewing file on any OS, which is what the second part is. It's not a formal application as a website, but it is an internet viewing file that can take you to the website.

# 🆒 Extended Version 🆒 (Icon) !

As we've seen, we've demonstrated your way through how you can create the water application on your own on a modern Mac without any concerns, issues, or relatable distresses.

However, there isn't something right for the icon, as it is not a PNG file and is instead, a water logo that has a white background.

To fix this, go to this link (https://github.com/Water607965/Water-Website-Icon) and download the GitHub contents of the GitHub repository to get the water site icon of the water site. Then, follow the instructions below.
