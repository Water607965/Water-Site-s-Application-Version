# 👋 Introduction 👋 !
Hello 👋! This is a web-based application of the water site. You must've seen this on the water site (sites.google.com/view/who-is-water) about this. You can download this to a computer, but it unfortunately must only be a MacOs operating system for it to work for the application. However, you can get an internet viewing file on any OS, which is what the second part is. It's not a formal application as a website, but it is an internet viewing file that can take you to the website.

# 🔽 Download Process 🔽 (For Application):

1. Before taking a look at the downlad process, ensure that you have your safari web browser launched.
2. Go to the website: https://h2owater.xyz
3. Go to the help menu in the Mac menu bar and type in "add to dock". Go to this link to see the screenshot for a better view (https://github.com/Water607965/Water-Site-s-Application-Version/assets/151555387/c28e6949-cdb8-47f3-bc50-403c4cd90797)
4. Click create application.
5. Run the application on your computer.

# 🔽 Download Process (For Internet Viewing File): 🔽 

1. Ensure that you have an active internet connection 🌐.
2. Launch the file 📁.
3. That's it! You're done! You've successfully launched the website file into your web browser (keep note, it is not an application) ✔️.


# 🆒 Extended Version 🆒 (Icon) !

As we've seen, we've demonstrated your way through how you can create the water application on your own on a modern Mac without any concerns, issues, or relatable distresses.

However, there isn't something right for the icon, as it is not a PNG file and is instead, a water logo that has a white background.

To fix this, go to this link (https://github.com/Water607965/Water-Website-Icon) and download the GitHub contents of the GitHub repository to get the water site icon of the water site. Then, follow the instructions below.

4. Do (Command + I) on your keyboard ⌨️.
